# Campusmart

## Overview
Campusmart is a high-performance, mobile-first e-commerce platform specifically engineered for campus ecosystems. Built with **Next.js 15** and **TypeScript**, the application provides students with a streamlined interface to browse, search, and purchase items ranging from fashion to electronics. The project emphasizes speed and accessibility, featuring a robust **Progressive Web App (PWA)** implementation and persistent state management to ensure a seamless user experience even in low-connectivity environments.

## Features
- **Mobile-First Experience**: Fully responsive interface designed for the "on-the-go" student lifestyle.
- **Persistent Shopping Cart**: Integrated **Zustand** state management with local storage persistence, ensuring cart data remains intact across sessions.
- **PWA Capabilities**: Service worker integration allowing for "Add to Home Screen" functionality and improved performance.
- **Dynamic Product Routing**: Highly optimized item pages featuring size selection, seller verification badges, and peer reviews.
- **Automated Calculations**: Real-time price and quantity updates during the checkout flow.
- **Modern UI/UX**: Clean aesthetic powered by **Tailwind CSS 4.0** and **Lucide React** icons.

## Getting Started

### Installation
Follow these steps to set up the development environment locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arnoldMidalla/campusmart_web
   cd campusmart_web
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Environment Variables
Currently, the project utilizes local mock data for product listings. Future integrations with a production backend will require the following configuration:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.campusmart.com/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_KEY=your_stripe_public_key
```

## Usage

### Navigation Flow
The application is structured into four primary modules:
1. **Discovery**: The homepage provides categorized filtering (Fashion, Tech, Food, etc.) and search functionality to find specific products.
2. **Product Detail**: Users can view high-resolution images, read detailed specifications, select sizes (S/M/L/XL), and check seller ratings before adding items to the cart.
3. **Cart Management**: Accessible via the navigation bar, the cart allows users to adjust quantities or remove items dynamically.
4. **Order Confirmation**: A dedicated checkout route provides a final summary of costs before proceeding to payment.

### Progressive Web App (PWA)
On supported mobile browsers, a prompt will automatically appear suggesting the user install the app. This provides a full-screen experience without browser address bars, mimicking a native mobile application.
